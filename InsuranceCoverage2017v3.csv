Notes,,,,,,
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by the Kaiser Family Foundation. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates. Please note that in the past, health coverage data posted to this site had used the Current Population Survey. We have replaced all previously-posted data, including data for previous years, with data based on ACS.  ",,,,,,

"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage.",,,,,,

A person reporting having Medicaid coverage and another type of coverage would be categorized as having Medicaid coverage in this analysis.,,,,,,
